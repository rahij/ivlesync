<h2>What this does:</h2>
Retrieves an NUS student's class details from IVLE and syncs them to Google Calendar.

Special Dependencies:

Enable Calendar Access to your Google API Developer Console. Configure your callback URL when enabling Calendar access in Google API according to where you host your project. It should call back to /project_folder/test.php

Building:

This is a web application. Copy them to your localhost/server and create constants.php in your project directory of the format:

<?php
$developerKey='google_api_developer_key';
$clientId='google_api_client_id';
$clientSecret='google_api_client_secret';
?>

[open script tag]
var APIKey="your_ivle_lapi_key";
[close script tag]

Starting dates for the first lesons are defined in test.php...(This is where the calendar sync takes place- forgive the poor file naming :p)

Cheers!
